					<p class="lead">BitShares is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on top of delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) blockchain technology. With all financial technology in the blockchain space, a major concern for users and traders is&nbsp;security.</p>

						<h2 class="display-5 red">Discontinuation</h2>
      <p class="lead">Please note that HacktheDEX will be discontinued. Applications received after April 15th will be ignored.</p>
      <p class="lead">We appreciate the time white-hackers have spent in identifying bugs in BitShares and hope for a great future. However, due to lack of community support, and significant changes in personell, we no can no longer maintain the HacktheDEX service at the quality it deserves.</p>
						<br><br>
						<h2 class="display-5">How It Works</h2>
						<p class="lead">If someone discovers a critical bug in the DEX, they might be tempted to exploit the bug, in an attempt to steal funds from unsuspecting users. Without a public bug bounty system, hackers do not have an obvious path of disclosure for reporting their findings. They also do not have any incentive to share their exploits and techniques, rather than using them for personal gain.
						<br><br>
						With this worker proposal, we've started a BitShares bug bounty program for security researchers and penetration testers (...aka hackers!) to disclose important security vulnerabilities they find within the BitShares core protocol, reference wallet, and related code repositories.
						<br><br>
						The proposal will use funds from the reserve pool to reward those that step forward with exploits, relative to the overall risk assessment of the exploit. The higher the payout for critical bugs, the more incentive there will be to attract higher quality researchers, and ultimately providing better security coverage for the DEX.
						<br><br>
						Worker proposal funds will be held in an escrow account by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation and unused funds will be refunded back to the network at the end of the proposal period.<br /><br /></p>
