						The bug bounty program is an experimental and discretionary rewards program for 
						our active community to encourage and reward those who are helping to improve 
						the platform. It is not a competition. You should know that the voters may  
						cancel the worker proposal at any time, and rewards are at the sole discretion of 
						the auditing panel. In addition, we are not able to issue rewards to individuals 
						who are on sanctions lists or who are in countries on sanctions lists 
						(e.g. North Korea, Iran, etc). You are responsible for all taxes. To be eligible for rewards, 
						we require your real name and a proof of your identity. All rewards are subject to applicable law. 
						Finally, your testing must not violate any law or compromise any data that is not yours.
